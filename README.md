# NShapeCreator
This application was created for easy visual modeling of new customized NShape shapes. The customization enables the simple addition of persist-able properties.
This was created for exact scale 2D modeling. Therefore, shapes cannot be resized (an 8 mm plug will always be 8mm). A scaling property was added in order to view the shape in a different size. 
All measurements are floating point millimeter sizes (allowing for very precise modeling).
