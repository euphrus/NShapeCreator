# NShapeCreator
Allows for the visual creation of NShape custom shape classes.
This is created for exact scale modeling.
Therefore, the shapes cannot be resized.
A scale property was added in order to view the shape in a differrent size.
All measuremnts are floating point millimeter sizes.
This is designed to easily create scale shapes and allow for the simple addition of persistable properties.
